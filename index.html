                <p style="width: 1000px;padding: 50px;background: papayawhip;">Mutton biryani is a beloved Indian dish
                    renowned for its aromatic flavors and tender meat. It's a
                    fragrant
                    rice dish cooked with succulent mutton pieces marinated in a blend of spices like cardamom,
                    cinnamon,
                    cloves, and bay leaves. The rice is typically cooked separately with spices, then layered with the
                    marinated
                    mutton and slow-cooked to perfection. Garnished with fried onions, mint leaves, and coriander, it's
                    a
                    feast
                    for both the eyes and the palate. Each bite offers a harmonious blend of spices, tender meat, and
                    fragrant
                    rice, making mutton biryani a favorite choice for special occasions and gatherings.

            </h3>
            <ol type="i">
                <li>To begin making the Mutton Dum Biryani Recipe, first we will make a paste of the ginger, garlic and
                    green chillies.</li>
                <li>Into a mixer grinder add the chopped ginger, garlic cloves and green chillies. Blend to make a paste
                    and
                    keep aside.</li>
                <li>Next step is to marinate the mutton for the Mutton Dum Biryani.</li>
                <li>Wash mutton thoroughly. Add the washed mutton into a mixing bowl and add the yogurt, 1 tablespoon of
                    the
                    ginger garlic and chilli paste, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, garam masala and salt to taste.

                <li>Once we are ready, the next step is to caramelize the onions.</li>
                <li>Into a preheated pan add oil and the sliced onions. Saute the onions on low to medium heat until

                    onions.</li>
                <li>If you brown the onions on high heat then the onions will not caramelize evenly</li>
                <li>Once done keep 1/2 the portion of the caramelized onions for the biryani masala and 1/2 portion for
                    garnishing the Mutton Dum Biryani.</li>
                <li>The next step is to cook the rice until it is 3/4th done.</li>
                <li>Into a saucepan add 4 cups of water, the bay leaf, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, cloves, salt to
                    taste
                    and the washed basmati rice. Allow the rice to boil in the water for 3 to 4 minutes</li>
                <li>Power cook the rice until 3/4th done. Once done drain the water from the rice, add a tablespoon of
                    ghee
                    to the rice and mix gently. Cover & keep aside.</li>

                    water to make a firm dough. Cover and keep aside.</li>
